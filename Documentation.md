# Django CRM App
Web Stack (Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript)

## Project
The project followed a carefully created Figma design with UI and UX concepts

## Apis
All apis start with the /api/v1/ prefix in case a v2 version needed in the future

Since this was my first time working with apis I had created I used AI help for the Customer Models.
<br>
API for creating, loading and filtering the data was created with the help of AI and specifically 'Gemini 3'.
<br>
**Note animations were my creations

All the next APIs such as the Todo, Search, Updating the Customer in from the table were created completely by me
